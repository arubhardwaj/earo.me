I am currently a PhD student supervised by [Di](http://www.dicook.org) and [Rob](http://robjhyndman.com) at Monash University. My PhD research focuses on tidy data structure and visualisation of temporal data, with open source implementation for R, [tsibble](http://pkg.earo.me/tsibble) and [sugrrants](http://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants).

I never manage to quit Vim at first glimpse. I switched my terminal to [Hyper](http://hyper.is) and haven't switched back since.
