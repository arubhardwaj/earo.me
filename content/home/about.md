I am a final year PhD student at Monash University. My [thesis](https://thesis.earo.me) is "Tidy tools for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data analysis", supervised by [Di](http://www.dicook.org) and [Rob](http://robjhyndman.com). I have developed several [![R](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)](https://www.r-project.org) packages for translating research methods, such as [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org) and [sugrrants](https://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants).

I am an advocate for open and reproducible research.
