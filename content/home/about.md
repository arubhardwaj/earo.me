Hi, I'm Earo. I'm currently grinding my Ph.D. on statistical visualisation of temporal-context data at Monash University. I'm also [#rstats](https://cran.r-project.org) user and developer. I love lightweight and elegant tools, for example, rmarkdown just works as a swiss army knife that powers my [blog](https://blog.earo.me)/slides/research papers.

```{r}
