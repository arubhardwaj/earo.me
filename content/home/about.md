I am currently a PhD student supervised by [Di](http://www.dicook.org) and [Rob](http://robjhyndman.com) at Monash University. My PhD research focuses on tidy data structure and visualisation of temporal data, with open source implementation for [![R](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)](https://www.r-project.org), [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org) and [sugrrants](https://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants).

I am an advocate for open reproducible research.
