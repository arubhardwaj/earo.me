I'm a PhD candidate at Monash University and future academic at University of Auckland. My research focuses on statistical computing and graphics, and data science. I translate research methodology into open source packages for [![R](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)](https://www.r-project.org). I have received the 2019 John Chambers Statistical Software Award from the ASA for developing the [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org) package. My [thesis](https://thesis.earo.me) is "Tidy tools for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data analysis", supervised by [Di](http://www.dicook.org) and [Rob](http://robjhyndman.com).

I'm an advocate for open and reproducible research. My research projects are structured in an opinionated way---an adapted form of [research compendium](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/).

I write [blog posts](https://blog.earo.me) and [technical notes](http://less.earo.me).

Briefly speaking, I turn coffee (mostly flat white) into code.
